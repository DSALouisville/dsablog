Until a few years ago I had been a lifelong “liberal” (I recall being 8 years
old and insisting my basketball coach call it “person-on-person” defense). My turn
toward the Left began while working as a social worker with young members of working
poor families. Family members shared with me various strategies used to afford food, shelter, school supplies, infant care, and other essentials. This was around the same time of the early 2010s’ particular resurgence of scorn for the working poor; criticizing many seeking assistance as “greedy” because they already have necessities such as functioning refrigerators or access to a phone line. Later, I started work with Louisvillians who were chronically homeless, giving me insight into our town’s most destitute- and their treatment.

I am not sharing this to yap about my own personal journey learning a lesson about privilege, though naturally that happened. I am sharing because while building these relationships, it became impossible to ignore the direct and intentional role of capitalism in this oppression. Oppression in the obvious forms such as abysmal wages and laborer’s disempowerment, to the cultural aspect of a startling and ugly lack of compassion for the dignity, worth, and welfare of all people. My exposure to others’ experiences did not make me simply “feel grateful for what I had.” They made me a budding socialist.

I am a new member of Democratic Socialists of America, having officially joined only this November. I joined, along with thousands of others, in the week following the general election. In an instant simply calling myself a socialist, engaging in lively political banter, and voting my conscience was not enough. It’s time to wake up every day and actively fight fascism and any ideology that facilitates or apologizes for it in any way. I believe DSA is a moral and sincerely intersectional network with the structure and resources necessary to effectively organize. I am ready to get started and will continue to read, listen, err, and learn in order to actively and effectively contribute to the revolution needed to bring forth real freedom and empowerment for _all_. Without exception.
