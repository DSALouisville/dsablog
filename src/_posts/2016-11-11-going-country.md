The election of Donald Trump followed a familiar path for Republican politicians. By running up large margins in rural areas, Trump was able to overwhelm Hillary Clinton and shock urban supporters of the Democratic candidate. The same process has repeatedly played out in Kentucky, when 55-60% of the vote in Louisville and Lexington go to the Democratic candidate, while the Republican sweeps to office with large margins in rural areas. Advocating for democratic socialism in Louisville can help build a political program that is more receptive to rural concerns than current Democratic policies. DSA Louisville can not only impact our city but can have an impact on the political situation outside our city limits.

Rural voters feel rejected by the political establishment completely. Poverty and unemployment are often still in crisis levels for much of rural Kentucky, but the national Democratic Party tells people in small towns with shuttered factories that “America is already great.” The popularity of Bernie Sanders’ democratic socialist message in rural areas was discounted by liberal pundits throughout the Democratic primary, but is related to the economic despair felt by residents of these areas. Leftists can offer an alternative message to the fascism offered by Republicans, and eat into the vote in the Republican heartland. While Democrats focus on driving up margins in urban areas we must also try to limit the gains made by Republicans everywhere else.

Why are so many rural Kentuckians and rural Americans turning to the fascism of Donald Trump? [Trump gained 11 points](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/11/donald-trump-election-polls-whites-working-class/) with the lowest income bracket measured in the 2016 exit polls compared to Mitt Romney in 2012, and 16 points with union households. This change is attributed to trade policy and the Democratic Party’s abandonment of the working class, but the important question is how to win those people back. While some voters surely voted for Trump based on his racist and xenophobic appeals, bigotry can’t explain why all of these voters swung from Barack Obama to Donald Trump, or why many voters simply stayed home.  Bernie Sanders has said for decades that [poor people don’t vote](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/26/bernie-sanders-is-right-poor-people-dont-vote), and it may be because neither major party offers them a platform on addressing their economic troubles. This is where socialism has an ability to appeal to new voters.

The way to win those voters is to bring them into the left coalition is by promoting a left-wing economic program of stronger labor unions, higher wages, free healthcare and education, and greater opportunities for worker ownership of the fruits of their labor. We may not win the votes of Trump’s biggest fans, and any leftist program that does not have a commitment to antiracism and diversity will not be a successful one. Many poor, rural voters are not looking for right-wing appeals, they just want help out of their situation. We can offer them solutions far better than what either liberals or conservatives are selling.
