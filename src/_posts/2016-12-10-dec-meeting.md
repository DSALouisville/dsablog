## Notes from DSA Louisville December Informational Meeting

![](/images/jeftweet.png)
It was a cold morning, but a great morning for socialism in Louisville! Twenty-five
of us met at the library to learn more about Democratic Socialists of America and what
we can do in our hometown to advance a more humane and compassionate society.

We began with Sarah leading a pair-share activity having everybody talk with a partner
about what brought them to the meeting. The responses were extremely on point.

Donald Trump has us shook

We are not here for slacktivism

Jody spoke to us about the values, strategy, and politics of DSA.  Much of what he talked
about can be found [ here ](http://www.dsausa.org/about_dsa) and [ here ](http://www.dsausa.org/socialist_strategy).

Nick spoke about the organizational structure of DSA, emphasizing *internal
democracy*.


Chris gave a short explanation of socialism, and the qualitative differences between
socialism and other currents in left-of-center American politics. Synopsis: Socialism
means working for *each other* instead of the bosses.

Now we get down to business. We split into four groups to rotate through four conversations.

A conversation on organizing and base building

A conversation on grassroots electoral politics

(yes, there was an adorable baby at the meeting üòä)

We took a look at next steps:

	1. Join DSA
	2. Read up on Democratic Socialism (reading list forthcoming)
	3. Next meeting will be to approve bylaws
	4. Organize your personal network!
	5. Begin formalizing and working in working groups

And we we wrapped up with a game rendition ‚ÄúSolidarity Forever‚Äù.

You can find the slides from the meeting [ here ](http://slides.com/chriscaragianis/deck).

This was a fantastic start. We‚Äôre updating our contact lists, planning our next events,
and bringing more socialists into the fold. Working groups are forming and setting agendas.
Many thanks to Louisville Free Public Library for lending us the space to work in.
