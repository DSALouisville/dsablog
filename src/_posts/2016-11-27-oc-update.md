title: Update from the DSA Louisville Organizing Committee
author: DSA Louisville OC
excerpt: What we've been up to, what to expect

---

Louisville DSA is underway! We have secured Organizing Committee status from [DSA](http://dsausa.org)
and have been hashing out our mission, priorities and vision. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dsa_louisville),
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/dsalouisville/) and [web](http://dsalouisville.org) communication
lines are open. In the coming week, look for the following:

- Publication of our Vision Statement, a guiding document that charts our course in these early days.
- Announcement of our initial Working Group Strategy. This is a map of initiatives led by OC members, and an outline of how Working Groups will proliferate and drive our work as a chapter.
- Introductions and personal stories of OC members
- Most importantly, details for our Open Informational Meeting, on December 10 @ 10:00 AM.

We have heard from so many people eager to jump into the fray and bring Democratic Socialism to Louisville. The wait is almost over. We canâ€™t wait to meet you and get down to the work of putting people over power.

Solidarity,

Louisville DSA Organizing Committee
