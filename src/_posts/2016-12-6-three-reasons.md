I asked myself, why should anyone bother coming out to [DSA Louisville’s Informational
Meeting](https://www.facebook.com/events/1147039548664697/) this Saturday?  Here’s what I came up with:

## Three Reasons to Organize With Democratic Socialists of America

### Capitalism has got to go.

From Standing Rock to empty factories, from segregated housing to privatized schools,
from Deepwater Horizon to militarized police, from employer based health insurance to the
screaming moral outrage of poverty, capitalism stands in the way of building a humane and
compassionate society. As Fred Hampton said, “we fight capitalism with socialism”.
Socialism is when people work together for mutual benefit rather than to enrich the ownership
class. We are getting together with [chapters](http://www.dsausa.org/chapters) across the country to chart a course from here to there.

### We can’t allow fascism to win

The fascism we see coagulating in the US is part of a
[troubling](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/21/neo-fascist-greek-party-election-golden-dawn-third-place)
[worldwide](http://www.salon.com/2015/12/08/is_france_going_fascist_extreme_right_national_front_is_now_the_most_popular_party/)
[trend](https://socialistworker.co.uk/art/38254/What+kind+of+a+party+is+Ukip)
. We have an immediate duty to protect people from it, to build a wall
of solidarity that is both intensely intersectional and broadly international. We are
organizing to resist, disrupt, and undermine fascism. Through direct action, education
and political pressure we will make it clear that we will not stand for strong-arming,
Nazi posturing and weaponized hate. We are committed to democracy, and we will fight for it.

### We’ve got the momentum

When a socialist organization grows by over 3,000 dues paying members in just a few days,
something is definitely up. Jacobin founder Bhaskar Sunkara put it this way: "Let's be
honest, no one has a clear strategy going forward but let's get in the same tent and figure
it out together.” The political left in the US is energized and the
immediate need for organized action couldn’t be more clear. DSA is emerging as a hub for
this activity, becoming a place where people with diverse priorities and backgrounds, newcomers
and “old heads”, reformers and revolutionaries, can get together to strategize and act.

If this resonates with you at all, we sure hope to see you Saturday Dec 10 at 10AM at
the main branch of Louisville Free Public Library ([FB event](https://www.facebook.com/events/1147039548664697/)).
