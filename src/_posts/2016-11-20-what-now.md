author: Chris Caragianis
excerpt:

You've made your decision for socialism. Now you want to know what to do next.

## 1. Join a Socialist Organization

The number one job of any socialist is to organize, because capitalism has
every advantage except numbers. Your organizational home is your first line of
cooperation. Organizations like DSA bring the talents, passions, and energy of
lots of people to bear on the world in a focused way. [Join]( https://dsausa.nationbuilder.com/join )
today!

## 2. Read about Socialism

The organization you joined in step 1 will have great reading suggestions for
you. Combating capitalism and oppression in a complex world is huge
undertaking. There's no way to understand your work and its crucial place in
this global struggle without some theory; a framing understanding of how things
work. [Jacobin](http://jacobinmag.com) has published an excellent [ guide ]( https://s3.jacobinmag.com/issues/jacobin-abcs.pdf ).

## 3. Participate

Now you have to go and do the thing. You planned it with your organization, you
grounded it in theoretical understanding, it's time to show up. You're going to
be working side by side and face to face with people. You're going to be
writing and speaking, marching and standing in the way. We're going to do it
together
