I find the focus on the sliver of a popular vote won by Hillary more depressing than anything. It's the definition of a pyrrhic victory. Yes, had we abolished the electoral college after 2000, she would have won by a sliver--maybe more if people didn't protest vote because they felt their vote didn't matter in their red-state homes. But she won by (at current count) ~300k votes. That's ~.25% of the voting public, and less than .1% of the American population. It feels like a rounding error at this point, and it makes up her entire margin of victory _against Donald Trump_.

Maybe it comforts you that, in another universe--one without the electoral college--Hillary won. That's not this universe. She knew the stakes, knew the game, outspent Trump by millions, and failed. Maybe it comforts you because you think that the popular vote shows that the hate you see across the country doesn't "represent the will of the American people," but it does--either through direct volition or indifference to the abject racism and misogyny that characterized Trump's campaign. Five million registered voters who voted in 2012 stayed home when faced with choosing between Hillary Clinton or the fearful, hateful id of White America made (orange) flesh.

Don't deny it happened with dreams of what could have been, or even marginally should have been. That is hollow, and it's the same delusional thinking that made Election Day come as such a shock to so many of us. Instead, deny its power with direct action. Show that it's untrue. Make this nation what you believe it to be. Fight this hate and ignorance with everything you have. Listen, and learn, and _teach_ your friends and loved ones about the continuing American scourges of oppression and depredation of women and racial and ethnic and LGBT minorities. Join as allies and agitate against the apathy and antipathy that leaves so many real and imagined walls between white and black and brown neighborhoods and neighbors. It’s (past) time we got uncomfortable. We've walled ourselves up in an echo chamber to avoid the hate that just sucker-punched us because we stopped looking at it. In the meantime, it never stopped hurting our fellow Americans, and now has a license and legitimacy wrought by electoral victory--a national referendum giving a green light to the apotheosis of its worst excesses. We have to confront it. Civility, or fear of impoliteness, has allowed it to fester even in people we know and love. We have to talk about it. We have to prove it's wrong and that it matters and that it hurts and kills people.

The time for focusing on what might have been ended when it no longer could be. Now we are in the suck, and there are so. many. ways. it can get worse. It’s on us to prevent that.
