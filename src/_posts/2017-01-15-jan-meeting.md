# January General Meeting

We met on January 3 in the basement of Louisville Free Public Library to
organize the next steps for our chapter and get to know some new faces turning
out for socialism in Louisville. It was a spirited and enthusiastic crew.

Here's the lowdown:

 - Introductions. Every time we meet there are new comrades anxious to help
   move the world toward socialism. This meeting was no different, we were
   happy to have long time leftys, the newly fired-up, and the curious coming
   together under one tent.
 - "Socialism 101" on the last Thursday of every month we will be meeting in an
   informal capacity to chat and learn about socialism and how we can take
   action toward a more compassionate society.
 - Small group discussions. We split into smaller groups for focused, topical
   conversations and brainstorming.
   - Inauguration Events
   - Liason with Louisville Antifa, awareness of far-right hate groups in the
     area
   - Gauging and generating interest in a Young Democratic Socialists chapter
     at University of Louisville
   - Liason with labor groups, Right to Work legislation poised to pass, action
     planning for anti-union events put on by Kentucky Chamber of Commerce
   - Working within electoral politics. Finding or _making_ candidates who will
     promote an agenda we can get behind. Specifically mentioned was working
     with [Emerge Kentucky](http://www.emergeky.org/).
   - How to have better meeting. Always in a self-reflective dialectic
   - Integrating with [The Ally Network](http://www.theallynetwork.org/)
     calendar and organizing tools.
  - Approving bylaws. After a short discussion, bylaws were approved
    unanimously. Central to the discussion was the importance of codifying
    diverse leadership. Also suggested was developing a proper Code of Conduct.

It was a productive night for socialism in Louisville. Our next meeting will be
Mon, February 6 at 7:00pm, and we hope to see you there.
