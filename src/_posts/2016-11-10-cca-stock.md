When I heard about this, I thought about the arguments I've seen between lefty folk about prioritizing "identitarian" politics and "economic" politics and how both sides are basically right, but fundamentally misunderstand each other.

Look at that graphic. _Capital_ is _building prisons_ to _lock people up in_.  And they are betting the farm that Donald Trump is going to give them lots of people to lock up. Why wouldn't they? He's been promising it for a year! His racist "law and order" dog whistling and baldly threatening rhetoric against immigrants and Muslims is _making people rich_.

The fact is that every struggle that pits people against power is intertwined with every other. White supremacy will not be defeated without anti-capitalist action, and captialism will not be defeated without anti-racist action. The strength of DSA is to bring together people with all kinds of stories, talents, identities, experiences and priorities to fight for _people_ over _power_.
