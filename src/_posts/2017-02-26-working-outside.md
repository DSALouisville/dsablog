After yesterday's DNC Chair election, a lot of people expressed dismay that leftists began talking about working outside the Democratic Party. This raises questions of disunity, but we are not talking about mindlessly splitting the vote without a plan. What are we talking about when we say the left has to work outside the Democratic Party? It's about building a movement not confined to a single political institution. It's about doing the work required to beat fascism, even if the Democratic establishment doesn't want to get involved.

Our theory of politics is that we must organize regular people to build a mass movement of the working and middle class, that includes all races, genders, religions, and sexual orientations. The way to do this is to unite people around a both/and model of social and economic justice. To get higher wages, we have to fight discrimination. To protect civil rights, we have to challenge corporate power. It's all interconnected.

This certainly could (in theory) be accomplished under the Democratic umbrella.  That would require leadership within the party who has the same organizational and ideological goals as the left does. I'm sure Tom Perez is a nice guy, but he's made it clear that he was running to maintain the establishment status quo. If he wanted to do the same things Keith Ellison was proposing, he wouldn't have ran and he wouldn't have done so with the backing of the establishment.

Therefore our organizing has to be done outside the Democratic Party. That doesn't mean we're all joining some obscure third party and leaving the Democrats to rot. Much like the conservative movement has established itself as an independent entity that does not exist solely within the Republican Party, the left must build a broad, grassroots movement that the Democrats are forced to listen to. That means organizing around issues we care about, challenging members of all parties when they favor corporations over working people, and participating in elections.

This will include Democratic primaries, even though the Democrats have decided they will continue their strategy of rallying around a single establishment picked candidate at the beginning of each election. We must build a movement so strong that it can overcome establishment support and win on people power instead of corporate power. But we must not be so blind as to only engage the Democrats. A plurality of American voters are independents, and not identified with either party. A leftist political movement will therefore have to include candidates who, in cases where the Democratic establishment is too difficult to beat at their own game, run as independents or third party candidates.

This movement will have to be anti-racist, anti-misogynist, pro-immigrant, and anti-capitalist. The hard work will be building a social and political base that can ultimately win elections. We are not there yet, but through difficult organizing and outreach work we can rally a winning coalition around our ideas and eventually our candidates. The Democratic Party will stand in our way at first, but to preserve their own survival they will eventually realize our movement cannot be ignored. At that point we may capture their leadership positions and institutional resources. But if that never happens, we will undertake the hard work of building a left coalition party that answers to working people instead of corporations.

All of this is the work that the Democratic Socialists of America is undertaking. If you know we can build a better future, please join us.
